Project Name: LIRA (Local Intelligent Retrieval Agent)
Developer: Niranjana Sajith Kumar
Date: December 2025

Project Overview:
LIRA is a document ingestion and retrieval application designed to run entirely on local hardware without requiring cloud APIs. It was built to satisfy the assessment requirements for an AI Engineering role.

Technical Architecture:
1. Frontend: The user interface is built using Streamlit, providing a simple web-based chat experience.
2. Backend: The API layer is powered by FastAPI, handling document uploads and query processing.
3. AI Engine: The system uses Ollama to run the Qwen 2.5 (1.5B) model for generating answers.
4. Database: Originally designed for Weaviate, the system was optimized to use ChromaDB to ensure compatibility with Windows laptops and 8GB RAM constraints.
5. Embeddings: Text is converted into vectors using the 'nomic-embed-text' model.

Key Features:
- Privacy-First: No data leaves the local machine.
- Lightweight: Optimized for standard laptops (CPUs) rather than requiring expensive GPUs.
- RAG Pipeline: Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation to answer questions based strictly on the uploaded documents.
